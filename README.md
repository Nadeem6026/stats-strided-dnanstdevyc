# 📊 Calculate Standard Deviation of Strided Array Ignoring NaN Values

Welcome to the repository for calculating the standard deviation of a double-precision floating-point strided array while ignoring NaN values. This repository implements a one-pass algorithm proposed by Youngs and Cramer. If you are working with arrays in JavaScript and need to compute the standard deviation while handling NaN values efficiently, this is the library for you.

## 📝 Description

In statistics, standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. When dealing with arrays of data, it's essential to calculate the standard deviation accurately. This repository provides a solution specifically tailored for double-precision floating-point strided arrays, ensuring that NaN values are excluded from the calculation.

## 🚀 Features

- One-pass algorithm for calculating standard deviation
- Handles NaN values in the array
- Optimized for double-precision floating-point data
- Easy integration into Node.js projects
